SharpNEAT 2.2.0

Changes from previous release (2.1.0).
=====================================


New Features
------------------


 * Walker BOX2D Problem Domain.
 
 * Support for multiple auxiliary fitness values per genome (plotted on graphs).

 * Acyclic networks as HyperNEAT CPPNs.




Fixes
-----

 * FIX: Prey Capture problem domain: Only one of the four ANN output signals was being read. 
   This effectively completely broke the prey capture domain.


 * IntPoint: Fixed equality and inequality operators and CalculateDistance(). 
   In the released code these defects severely affected the prey capture domain.


 * FIX: Config loading: Relaxing network delta threshold setting was being parsed as an Int32 instead of a Double.


 * Fix to RandomClusteringStrategy.cs. Genome.SpecieIdx was not being set upon allocation. 
   Added debug assertion to check specieIdx is correctly set following speciation.
    
    
 * FIX/MOD: Network visualisation: Layout logic failed when there were large numbers of neurons in
   a layout layer such that the gap between them was less than 0.5 of a pixel, and thus got rounded down to 0,
   positioning all nodes in that layer at the same coordinates.
   
    
 * FIX/MOD: Ensure ID generators are set accordingly when loading genomes using a pre-existing genome factory.
